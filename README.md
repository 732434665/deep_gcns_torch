# DeepGCNs: Can GCNs Go as Deep as CNNs?
In this work, we present new ways to successfully train very deep GCNs. We borrow concepts from CNNs, mainly residual/dense connections and dilated convolutions, and adapt them to GCN architectures. Through extensive experiments, we show the positive effect of these deep GCN frameworks.

## Overview
We do extensive experiments to show how different components (#Layers, #Filters, #Nearest Neighbors, Dilation, etc.) effect `DeepGCNs`. We also provide ablation studies on different type of Deep GCNs (MRGCN, EdgeConv, GraphSage and GIN).
